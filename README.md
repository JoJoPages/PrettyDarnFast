# Pretty Darn Fast

This book is free for those looking to improve their mental health and reduce anxiety.

It's a compendium of many great teachings in an easy-to-read lightweight format.

We take no responsibility for the content. It's not a substitute for therapy, but we hope it helps. 

We are not therapists, however a therapist did write this about the book:

> “What Justin and Ann-Marie have created here is from a truly heart centred place and whilst no substitute for therapy, I believe it can have real impact for those wishing to improve their mental health.  Packed full of wisdom, strategies and easy to use tools that encourages the reader to prioritise their wellbeing, take action and seek further support when required”.
